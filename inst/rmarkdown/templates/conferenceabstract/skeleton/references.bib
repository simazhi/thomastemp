little attention in Western linguistic discussion—‘emotional adverbs’. In the Chinese
linguistic tradition, ‘emotional adverbs’ belong to the general category of xu¯cı´ (‘empty
words’), whose meanings are often thought to be too elusive to pin down. By carrying out
systematic and in-depth semantic analyses of a selected set—yo`u, pia¯n, and jı`ng—the paper
illustrates that so-called ‘empty words’ are rich in semantic content, and their meanings can
be explicated fully using Natural Semantic Metalanguage, thus making this category and
its semantic content accessible to both linguists and learners of the Chinese (Mandarin)
language. The analysis also shows that it is important to take into consideration grammatical
constructions in establishing polysemy and obtaining a comprehensive understanding of
the full range of meanings of the words under discussion.},

(semantic primes) can be applied to semantic analysis in little-described
languages. It is argued that using lexical universals as a vocabulary for semantic
analysis allows one to formulate meaning descriptions that are rigorous,
cognitively authentic, maximally translatable, and free from Anglocentrism. A
second goal is to shed light on methodological issues in semantic fieldwork by
interrogating some controversial claims about the Dalabon and Pirahã languages.
We argue that reductive paraphrase into lexical universals provides a
practical procedure for arriving at coherent interpretations of unfamiliar lexical
meanings. Other indigenous/endangered languages discussed include East Cree,
Arrernte, Kayardild, Karuk, and Maori. We urge field linguists to take the NSM
metalanguage, based on lexical universals, into the field with them, both as an
aid to lexicogrammatical documentation and analysis and as a way to improve
semantic communication with consultants.},

  abstract = {Iconicity, a resemblance between properties of linguistic form (both in spoken
and signed languages) and meaning, has traditionally been considered to be a
marginal, irrelevant phenomenon for our understanding of language processing,
development and evolution. Rather, the arbitrary and symbolic nature
of language has long been taken as a design feature of the human linguistic
system. In this paper, we propose an alternative framework in which iconicity
in face-to-face communication (spoken and signed) is a powerful vehicle for
bridging between language and human sensori-motor experience, and, as
such, iconicity provides a key to understanding language evolution, development
and processing. In language evolution, iconicity might have played a key
role in establishing displacement (the ability of language to refer beyond what is
immediately present), which is core towhat language does; in ontogenesis, iconicity
might play a critical role in supporting referentiality (learning to map
linguistic labels to objects, events, etc., in the world), which is core to vocabulary
development. Finally, in language processing, iconicity could provide a
mechanism to account for how language comes to be embodied (grounded in
our sensory and motor systems), which is core to meaningful communication.},

  volume = {167},
  abstract = {One of the main challenges in automatically generating textual weather forecasts is choosing appropriate
English words to communicate numeric weather data. A corpus-based analysis of how
humans write forecasts showed that there were major differences in how individual writers performed
this task, that is, in how they translated data into words. These differences included both different
preferences between potential near-synonyms that could be used to express information, and also differences
in the meanings that individual writers associated with specific words. Because we thought
these differences could confuse readers, we built our SUMTIME-MOUSAM weather-forecast generator
to use consistent data-to-word rules, which avoided words which were only used by a few people,
and words which were interpreted differently by different people. An evaluation by forecast users
suggested that they preferred SUMTIME-MOUSAM’s texts to human-generated texts, in part because
of better word choice; this may be the first time that an evaluation has shown that NLG texts are better
than human-authored texts.

The paper proposes a typology of meteorological constructions that are divided into three according to the element primarily responsible for the coding of weather. In the predicate type, a predicate expresses the meteorological event, while an argument has other functions. In the argument type, an argument is responsible for expressing weather, while any eventual predicate is semantically rather vacuous. In the argument-predicate type, finally, a predicate and an argument are both involved. All types include subtypes, depending on the syntactic valency and the parts of speech of the elements involved. Building upon the typology of constructions, a typology of languages is also proposed based on the coding of precipitation and temperature.

weather verbs (to rain, to snow, to thunder a.o.) in the framework proposed by Hale and
Keyser (2002). Starting from the idea that weather verbs sometimes take Agents as
subjects, and sometimes Themes, we would like to propose that they can be
decomposed either as V+N (rain = ‘FALL RAIN”), or as CAUSE followed by V+N
(‘CAUSE [FALL RAIN]’). The article brings cross-linguistic evidence in favor of this
proposal, showing that weather verbs in languages across the world display an
ambiguous behavior, sometimes behaving like unaccusatives, and sometimes like
unergatives.

This review surveys recent developments in ideophone research. Work on the semiotics of ideophones helps explain why they are marked and how they realise the depictive potential of speech. A true semantic typology of ideophone systems is coming within reach through a combination of language-internal analyses and language-independent elicitation tools. Documentation of ideophones in a wide variety of genres as well as sequential analysis of ideophone use in natural discourse leads to new insights about their interactional uses and about their relation to other linguistic devices like reported speech and grammatical evidentials. As the study of ideophones is coming of age, it sheds new light on what is possible and probable in human language.},

A text of fragments and phrases in five different languages (Armenian, Russian, Italian, French, and English, all of which have unique vowel sounds) are associated with the various wavy lines ("Hampart-zuom Dirouhi Di questa terra Naprasno Conscience et Arise!"). The choice of the specific styles and the extra-musical sounds are made by the performer. For example, in the late Cathy Berberian's realization released on a vinyl recording in the 1960s, she chose to assign the dark blue color to jazz inflections, red to deep contralto intonations ("idyot a.k.u. oakhoa far-removed"), black with parallel dotted lines was delivered in Arnold Schoenberg's sprechstimme vocal style (a kind of pitched speech) ("Poost ya the burning bush"), black tint alone was identified with "dramatic," purple suggested the famous actress/singer Marlene Dietrich's breathy and sultry style ("Will you give me to tell you?"), yellow tinted material was delivered in a bright coloratura opera style ("Odyodzke cinq not as a birth but as love"), green was folk music timbres of various sorts, orange was Oriental (Chinese opera, etc.), light blue suggested baby sounds to Berberian, and brown was reserved for nasal intonations. The various extra-musical sounds in Berberian's realization consisted of electronic bursts and processed natural, extra-musical, or environmental sounds in a musique concrète manner. This radical composition not only introduced the element of indeterminacy to vocal music but also changed the nature of emotional gestures in singing by moving away from linear narrative and imagery to the expression and appreciation of these gestures as a kind of database available in ordinary language, and to the utilization of language as sound per se.

  abstract = {Anthony, Laurence. 2013. A critical look at software tools in corpus linguistics. Linguistic
Research 30(2), 141-161. Corpora are often referred to as the ‘tools’ of corpus linguistics.
However, it is important to recognize that corpora are simply linguistic data and
that specialized software tools are required to view and analyze them. The functionality
offered by software tools largely dictates what corpus linguistics research methods
are available to a researcher, and hence, the design of tools will become an increasingly
important factor as corpora become larger and the statistical analysis of linguistic
data becomes increasingly complex. In this paper, I will first discuss how separating
the data from the tools resolves various issues that are hotly debated within the
field. Next, I will offer a critical look at the development of four generations of
corpus tools, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Then, I will discuss the
role of programming in corpus linguistics tools creation and present a model for
the development of future corpus tools. Finally, I will show a real-world example
of a next-generation corpus tool that was developed for use in language learning.

The resources provided here include: Chinese Dictionary, Chinese Phrase Dictionary, Idiom Dictionary, Chinese Poetry, Han Dian Calligraphy, Practical Aids Appendix, and Han Dian Tools. The unique feature in Han Dian's Chinese Dictionary is that it offers not only a detailed history of each Chinese character, but also explanations from Kangxi Zi Dian and Shuo Wen Jie Zi. The website also has link to LongWiki's Han Dian Gu Ji where a digital collection of nearly 40,000 Chinese classics is available for users to explore.},

  shorttitle = {Helping Doctoral Students Write},
  abstract = {"Helping Doctoral Students Write offers a new approach to doctoral writing. By treating research as writing and writing as research, the authors offer pedagogical strategies for doctoral supervisors that will assist the production of well-argued and lively dissertations." "It is clear that many doctoral candidates find research writing complicated and difficult, but the advice they receive often glosses over the complexities of writing and/or locates the problem in the writer. Rejecting the DIY websites and manuals that promote a privatized, skills-based approach to writing research, Kamler and Thomson provide a new framework for scholarly work that is located in personal institutional and cultural contexts. Their discussion of the complexities of forming a scholarly identity is illustrated by stories and writings of actual doctoral students." "The pedagogical approach developed in the book is based on the notion of writing as a social practice. This approach allows supervisors to think of doctoral writers as novices who need to learn new ways with words as they enter the discursive practices of scholarly communities. This involves learning sophisticated writing practices with specific sets of conventions and textual characteristics. The authors offer supervisors practical advice on helping with commonly encountered writing tasks such as the proposal, the journal abstract, the literature review and constructing the dissertation argument." "In conclusion, they present a persuasive argument that universities must move away from simply auditing supervision to supporting the development of scholarly research communities. Any doctoral supervisor keen to help their students develop as academics will find the new ideas presented in this book fascinating and insightful reading."--Jacket},

  abstract = {Bringing together the voices of scholars from Europe and North America with those of key contest stakeholders, "Performing the 'New' Europe: Identities, Feelings, and Politics in the Eurovision Song Contest" argues that this popular music competition is a symbolic contact zone between European cultures: an arena for European identification in which both national solidarity and participation in a European identity are confirmed, and a site where cultural struggles over the meanings, frontiers and limits of Europe are enacted. This exciting collection explores the ways in which European artists perform, disavow, and contest their racial, national, and sexual identities in the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), and asks difficult questions about European inclusions and exclusions the contest reflects. It suggests the ESC as an ever-evolving network of peoples and places transcending both historical and geographical boundaries of Europe that brings into being new understandings of the relationship between culture, space, and identities.},

  abstract = {"Language demonstrates structure while also showing considerable variation at all levels: languages differ from one another while still being shaped by the same principles; utterances within a language differ from one another while exhibiting the same structural patterns; languages change over time, but in fairly regular ways. This book focuses on the dynamic processes that create languages and give them their structure and variance. It outlines a theory of language that addresses the nature of grammar, taking into account its variance and gradience, and seeks explanation in terms of the recurrent processes that operate in language use. The evidence is based on the study of large corpora of spoken and written language, what we know about how languages change, as well as the results of experiments with language users. The result is an integrated theory of language use and language change which has implications for cognitive processing and language evolution"--Provided by publisher},
